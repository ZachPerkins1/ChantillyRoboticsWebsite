          FIRST (For The Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international organization that challenges young people to solve various challenges using a combination of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. FIRST offers four programs: FIRST Lego League Junior (FLL Jr.), FIRST Lego League (FLL), First Tech Challenge (FTC), and FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Each level is given a different challenge every year, and teams must use their engineering experiences to complete their respective goals.

          FIRST Robotics Competition was created in 1992. It has since grown from a small-town competition held in a high school gymnasium into the world’s largest robotics competition. Currently, the FIRST Robotics Competition has expanded to over seventeen countries, and is comprised of over 2,720 teams and 47,500 members. Each year, teams are given a specific challenge and an optional kit of parts. Teams order, design, and construct a robot that will succeed in the challenge they have been presented with.

            In 1999, FIRST Lego League was created in order to teach children ages 9-14 about science and technology in an engaging way. Every year, NASA and FIRST announce a new challenge centered around a real world problem, such as global warming or food preservation. The members of the team must design and program a Lego MINDSTORMS® robot to complete the tasks pertaining to the challenge they were given. Finally, the members must present a robot design summary, complete a research project, and demonstrate FIRST core values such as spirit and gracious professionalism.

            Junior FIRST Lego League (FLL Jr.) was established in 2004 to allow children ages 6-10 to experience science and technology. As with FLL, the children use basic engineering concepts and LEGOs in order to build a robot that will solve a real-world problem. Additionally, the children make a poster and to present themselves to judges.

            FIRST Tech Challenge was formed in 2005 as a low-cost alternative to FIRST Robotics Competition. Similar to the FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST Tech Challenge members are given a new challenge and a kit of parts every year. They must document their progress within an “engineering notebook” as they build and program a robot to complete their challenge.
