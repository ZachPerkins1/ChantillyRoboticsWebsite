        <p class="text">
          FIRST (For The Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international organization that challenges young people to solve various challenges using a combination of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. FIRST offers four programs: FIRST Lego League Junior (FLL Jr.), FIRST Lego League (FLL), First Tech Challenge (FTC), and FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Each level is given a different challenge every year and must use their engineering experiences to complete their respective goals.

          The FIRST Robotics Competition was created in 1992, and was held in a high school gymnasium, in New Hampshire. Twenty-eight teams participated, and the competition started out as individual wins. Until 2005, competitions were played 2, 3, and 4 team alliances; now, competitions consist of two three team alliances against each other. After more than two decades, the competition has expanded to seventeen countries, with about 2,720 teams and 47,500 members.

            In 1999, FIRST Lego League was created in order to teach children ages 9-14 about science and technology in an engaging way. Since then, NASA and FIRST have announced a new challenge centered around a real world problem, such as global warming or food preservation. The members of the team must design and program a Lego MINDSTORMS® robot to complete the tasks pertaining to the challenge they were given. Finally, the members must present a robot design summary, complete a research project, and demonstrate FIRST core values such as spirit and gracious professionalism.

            FIRST Tech Challenge was formed in 2005 as a low-cost alternative to FIRST Robotics Challenge. Similar to the FIRST Robotics Challenge, FIRST Tech Challenge members are given a new challenge and a kit of parts every year. They must document their progress within an “engineering notebook” as they build and program a robot to complete their challenge.
